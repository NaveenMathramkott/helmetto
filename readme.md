<h2 align="center">MERN full-stack E-Store web app</h2>

   <div align="center">
    The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack was used to create this full-stack online application, which also includes a Three.js-powered 3D product configurator. It is a flexible tool for e-commerce or product design platforms as it enables users to interactively alter 3D models in real-time.

## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

This full-stack application creates a dynamic 3D product modification tool by fusing the interactivity of Three.js with the capabilities of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The configurator, which was created for e-commerce or product design platforms, gives customers the ability to alter 3D models in real time, providing a rich, dynamic experience. With a completely responsive design, real-time updates, and a safe and scalable backend, this project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack programming and 3D visualization while providing a useful and entertaining user experience.
